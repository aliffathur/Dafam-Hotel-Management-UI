# Dafam-Hotel-Management-UI
Here I will share a project I've worked on, namely Dafam UI Hotel Management. In developing this UI, I previously conducted a thorough analysis of requirements, considering both client desires and the future target users. After conducting the analysis, I proceeded with modeling to formulate the requirements into low-fidelity designs and create the architecture for the UX. The next step was to present the modeling results to the Project Manager. Once the designs were approved, I moved on to the high-fidelity design phase and prototyping
